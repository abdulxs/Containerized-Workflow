### Test workflow

Wafi uses the microservice software architecture. The microservices approach to software development helps teams deploy faster, but it comes with some issues, one of them is data consistency. How can data change in microservice A be propagated to microservice B and C? Send it via an event?

Yes, that works but what if B updates itself and C had hiccups and just could not make the update? üôÑ

Then that means we need to have a mechanism that allows us to handle such failures, make retries and what-else? Just how many of the situations like above do we have to write failures and retry logic for? 

Wafi uses [Temporal](https://temporal.io) as a microservice orchestrator which helps solve the issues stated above

## Your task

* Deploy a temporal cluster for production. Follow the deployment guide [here](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server/production-deployment). A plus is if you are able to implement any of the security considerations stated [here](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server/security)

* Package this temporal app as a docker image
  * write a CICD for the app.
  * deploy the app using Kubernetes
  * How would you improve this app?



This is required for the worker to be up

```bash
go run ./worker/main.go
```

‚Äã	

Execute the helloworkflow

```bash
go run ./starter/main.go
```



Please note that the temporal server needs to be up before the above commands work



See you soon üëãüèª.
